# Modern TypeScript Monorepo Template

This repo is a **demo monorepo template** meant to evolve into a clear, modern reference example, so I am inviting everyone to contribute to it and make it better.

Everything here is **illustrative, not prescriptive** — pick what you like, swap what you don’t (ORM/RPC/auth/testing/etc.).

If you’re reviewing this, I’d love feedback and PRs to help build it up.

Note: This kind of repo structure has served me really well in startups and in personal projects. If you have a bigger team, more enterprisey needs, you might want to consider a more traditional monorepo structure that people are more familiar with. If you have any questions you can reach out via email, twitter, github or wherever you find me.

## Intro

Please give your thoughts — the idea for this monorepo is to showcase how you might approach a monorepo that will grow with your company. It tries to balance DX with scalability/maintainability.

It’s a modern TypeScript Turbo monorepo with pnpm, Vite, React, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Zod, neverthrow, pino, Postgres, Kysely, Atlas, Biome, Vitest, etc. This is close to what I use day-to-day in personal projects and client work.

Important: there are **no builds** for the main apps during dev (both frontend and backend are JIT). This repo is not meant to publish packages to npm.

## Technology choices

| Category | Choice | Why | Where | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monorepo | Turbo + pnpm workspaces/catalog | Fast task orchestration + centralized dependency versions | repo root | `turbo.json` |
| Frontend | Vite + React 19 + TanStack Router | Fast DX + simple routing | `apps/frontend/web` | (this README) |
| Mobile | Expo + React Native | Cross-platform native apps | `apps/frontend/mobile` | `docs/mobile.md` |
| UI | Tailwind + shadcn/ui | Speed + composable primitives | `packages/frontend/web` | (this README) |
| API | Hono + oRPC | Lightweight HTTP + end-to-end type-safe RPC | `apps/backend/api` | `docs/ORPC.md` |
| Auth | Better Auth | Batteries-included auth | `apps/backend/api/src/auth.ts` | `docs/AUTH.md` |
| DB | Postgres + Kysely | Typed query builder | `packages/backend/core/src/db.ts` | `docs/DB.md` |
| Schema/migrations | Atlas + `db/schema.sql` | SQL source-of-truth + deterministic apply | `db/schema.sql` + `just db-migrate` | `docs/DB.md` |
| Validation | Zod | Runtime validation + types | services/routers | `docs/CONFIG.md` |
| Errors | neverthrow | Explicit Result flow | services | `docs/NEVERTHROW.md` |
| Testing | Vitest + testcontainers | Real Postgres tests that are still fast | backend packages | `docs/TESTING.md` |
| Lint/format | Biome | One fast tool | repo root | `biome.json` |
| Logging | pino | Structured logs | backend apps | `docs/LOGGING.md` |

## Repo structure

- `apps/backend/api`: Hono server, Better Auth, oRPC router, services (user + todo), Vitest tests
- `apps/frontend/web`: Vite + React app (home page is the TODO CRUD demo)
- `apps/frontend/landing`: Astro static landing site (this repo's "front door")
- `apps/frontend/mobile`: Expo React Native mobile app (WIP Better Auth integration)
- `packages/backend/core`: shared backend core (DB, config, auth helpers, validation, test helpers, generated schema types)
- `packages/frontend/web`: shared UI/components library (shadcn components)
- `packages/shared/*`: shared configs + tiny example package (`hello`)
- `db/schema.sql`: canonical schema (used by Atlas and tests)
- `docs/`: concise “how this works” docs

## Getting started (non-Devbox path)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (targets Node 24+)
- pnpm (see the pinned version in root `package.json`)
- Docker (for Postgres)
- Atlas + Just (recommended, because `just setup` uses them)

### Setup

1) Install deps:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2) Environment variables

- root (docker compose): copy `.env.example` → `.env` (only used by `compose.yml`)
- backend: copy `apps/backend/api/.env.example` → `apps/backend/api/.env`
- frontend: copy `apps/frontend/web/.env.development.example` → `apps/frontend/web/.env.development`
  - Note: Vite loads `.env` (shared across all modes) and `.env.[mode]` (mode-specific)
  - See `apps/frontend/web/.env.example` for more details on Vite's env loading order

3) Start Postgres + apply schema:

```bash
just setup
```

4) Start dev:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Getting started (Devbox option)

Devbox is optional, but convenient (installs Node/pnpm/Atlas/Just):

```bash
devbox shell
```

Then run the same steps (`pnpm install`, `just setup`, `pnpm dev`).

## Worktree Workflow (Parallel Development)

This repo supports [Worktrunk](https://worktrunk.dev/) for parallel feature development using git worktrees. Each worktree gets its own working copy, dependencies, and environment.

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Install worktrunk (macOS)
brew install worktrunk/tap/worktrunk

# Setup shell integration (required)
wt config shell install

# Configure worktree path (required for non-bare repos)
wt config create
# Add to ~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml:
#   worktree-path = "../{{ branch | sanitize }}"

# Create a new worktree
wt switch -c feature/my-feature
# Auto-runs: copies .env + node_modules, runs pnpm install

# Work on your feature
just setup && pnpm dev

# Merge and cleanup when done
wt merge  # Squashes, merges, removes worktree
```

See `docs/worktree.md` for full documentation.

## Useful commands

- `pnpm dev` / `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm lint:check` / `pnpm format:check` / `pnpm test`
- `pnpm -C apps/backend/api test`
- `pnpm -C apps/frontend/landing dev`
- `just setup` (docker + migrate), `just db-migrate` (schema “push”), `just db-schema`, `just db-psql`
- Versioned migrations (Atlas, still based on `db/schema.sql`):
  - `just db-migration-new add_todos`
  - `just db-migration-apply`
- Find improvement spots (all `TODO:` comments):
  - `rg -n "TODO:" .`
  - (fallback) `grep -RIn "TODO:" .`

## Known rough edges / help wanted

- Node/shared package HMR is still not great (would love best practices for “JIT workspace packages” + watch mode).
- Vitest + workspace “subpath imports” (`#*`) can be tricky. I currently work around it with a custom resolver plugin in `apps/backend/api/vitest.config.ts` (not sure if this is the best solution).
- The shared testcontainers singleton approach is intentionally aggressive for speed; I’m still evaluating whether it’s the right default long-term.

## CI/CD

- **Local**: Husky runs `lint:check`, `format:check`, and `typecheck` on `pre-push`.
- **CI**: GitHub Actions runs those checks + `pnpm test` on every PR.
- Details: `docs/CICD.md`.

## Skills (AI Workflows)

Move skills into appropriate folder on your system or repository. Since each provider requires a different location, see your LLM provider docs for relevant locations, eg. Codex can be placed inside `.codex/skills/` while Claude can be placed inside `./.claude/skills/`

This repo includes [Skills](docs/skills.md) — modular instruction sets that help AI agents work effectively in this codebase.

Skills live in `.agents/skills/` and work tracking lives in `.work/`. See `docs/skills.md` for details.

## OmniDev

We built OmniDev to stop reinventing AI tooling setups across providers and repos. It lets you package and share capabilities (skills, rules, hooks, commands) once, then load the right set for the task at hand.
